### Hi there <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif" width="22" height="22"/> I am TamÃ¡s


and I am a postdoctoral NLP researcher at the [Institute Centre for Information Modelling](https://informationsmodellierung.uni-graz.at/en/), [UniGraz](https://www.uni-graz.at)

- ðŸš€  I'm currently working on the [DiDip ERC project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101019327), which examines European trends and regional disparities in the production and usage of 14th- and 15th-century charters written in low-resource languages (e.g., [DE-StadtA-BOR-W 84](https://images.monasterium.net/img/DE-StadtA-BOR-W/Urkunden/StadtA_BORK-W_U084_r.JPG)). We are using natural language processing, and computer vision to address questions like: How do local and regional practices react to the diffusion of Roman law among European legal thinkers? How do seal and notarial signature authentication compare? Overall, we want to use distant reading on our medieval, sometimes heavily corrupted material
